<p>In the course of the preparation of a synopsis of the North
American terrestrial microtines by one of us (Cockrum), and the
completion of a Master's thesis on the geographical variation of
the red-backed mice of Wyoming by the other (Fitch) we had
occasion to study the red-backed mice of the southern Rocky
Mountain region (see figure 1). Results of these studies are the
recognition of two heretofore unnamed subspecies of the red-backed
mouse in the southern Rocky Mountain region, and a clarification
of the taxonomic status of two additional kinds.</p>

<p><i>Type locality.</i>--Ward, 9500 feet, Boulder County, Colorado.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>--The Rocky Mountains of extreme southern Alberta, Montana,
northwestern and southern Wyoming, and north and central Colorado.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>--<i>C. g. galei</i>, with the largest geographic range of any
of the Rocky Mountain subspecies, is also the most variable. Three
principal areas of geographic variation were found. These areas
are: The mountains of north-central Colorado and southern Wyoming
(this area includes the type locality); the Big Horn area
probably northwest into Montana (no adult specimens from Montana
or Alberta examined); and the Teton area which includes the
mountains east and southeast of Yellowstone National Park. Specimens
from these areas have noticeable differences in pelage, but
no constant cranial differentiation could be detected. Specimens
from the Medicine Bow Mountains of southern Wyoming have a
more reddish dorsal stripe, and more buff and less gray on the
sides than either of the northern geographic variants. The dorsal
stripe continues farther anteriorly and is better defined through its
entire length. There are fewer differences between the two northern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
geographic variants than between either one of them and the
southern variant. Specimens from the Teton Mountains, however,
have grayer sides, and the outer margin of the ear is tipped with
chestnut (little or no chestnut shows on the ears of the specimens
from the Big Horn Mountains); the dorsal stripe is less distinct
(with slightly more gray throughout) than in either of the other
geographic variants of the one subspecies.</p>

<p>Three specimens (two adults) are available from the Little Medicine
Range in Converse County (22 miles south and 24.5 miles
west of Douglas, 7600 feet), Wyoming. Although red-backed mice
probably are found in the mountains of Natrona and Albany counties,
the population, in the Little Medicine Range is somewhat isolated.
In coloration these mice are lighter than any of the three
geographic variants described above; the dorsal stripe is narrower;
the sides are more buffy; the dorsal stripe does not project anteriorly
beyond the ears as it does in the specimens from the Medicine Bow
Mountains; and the face is grayer. These specimens resemble the
population in the Big Horn Mountains to the north more than the
population in the Medicine Bow Mountains.<br />

The specimens from the Little Medicine Range, the Big Horn
Range, and the Tetons are possibly subspecifically distinct from
the southern specimens. Examination of specimens now allocated
to <i>galei</i> from Montana and Alberta should aid in revealing whether
the northern animals are an unnamed subspecies.</p>

<p><i>Type locality.</i>--Three miles N Custer, 6000 ft., South Dakota.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>--The Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>--Merriam (N. Amer. Fauna, 5:119, July 30, 1891)
named this subspecies on the basis of two specimens collected in
the Black Hills of South Dakota in July, 1888, and assigned it to
the species <i>Evotomys</i> [= <i>Clethrionomys</i>] <i>gapperi</i>. He reported the
diagnostic characteristics as: "Similar to <i>E. gapperi</i>, but with larger
ears and shorter tail. The hazel of the dorsal area is not so bright
as in <i>gapperi</i>; the sides are the same golden brown." Of the cranial
and dental characteristics he wrote: "Much as in <i>E. gapperi</i>."</p>

<p>Bailey (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 11:129, May 13, 1897), in
his "Revision of the American voles of the genus <i>Evotomys</i>," with
one additional specimen available, raised the Black Hills population
to specific status, re-emphasizing the shortness of the tail, and
pointing out a few slight cranial differences ("zygomatic arches
low and flaring out, so that the inner instead of the outer side shows
in top view; auditory bullae as large as in <i>gapperi</i>, but less
rounded").</p>

<p>Bailey (<i>loc. cit.</i>) remarked that: "though based on so scanty
material, the characters distinguishing the species are fairly pronounced.
Its range is isolated and widely separated from that of
any other members of the genus by open prairie country and a wide
belt of the Transition zone. There seems to be no valid reason for
considering it a subspecies."</p>

<p>Additional specimens have been taken in recent years from the
Black Hills of South Dakota and northeastern Wyoming. This
material has shed light on the relationships and morphological
characteristics of the red-backed mice of this region. Bole and
Moulthrop (Sci. Publ. Cleveland Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:153, September
11, 1942) listed, as comparative material, eight specimens from
Bull Springs, Custer County, South Dakota, under the name <i>Clethrionomys
gapperi brevicaudus</i> (Merriam). They gave no reason
for arranging <i>brevicaudus</i> as a subspecies of <i>C. gapperi</i>.</p>

<p>Twenty adults (11 skins and skulls, 9 skulls only) from Pennington
County, South Dakota (specimens in the University of Michigan
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Museum of Zoology), have the following measurements (averages
of external measurements based on 11 specimens only): Total
length, 142 (123-155); tail, 35 (30-39); hind foot, 19.5 (18.6-21.0);
basal length, 23.3 (21.7-24.5); condylobasilar length, 23.3 (21.9-24.5);
zygomatic breadth, 13.7 (12.9-14.7); lambdoidal breadth,
11.7 (11.3-12.9); alveolar length upper cheek-teeth, 5.5 (5.2-5.8);
interorbital breadth, 3.9 (3.6-4.1); length of nasals, 7.7 (7.1-8.5);
breadth of rostrum, 3.2 (2.9-3.6); and length of incisive foramina,
5.0 (4.6-5.3).</p>

<p>Measurements of the type and one "more fully adult topotype"
(as given by Bailey, <i>op. cit.</i>) are: Total length, 125, 130; tail length,
31, 32; hind foot, 19, 19; basal length, 21.2, 21.8; length of nasals,
6.6, 7.0; zygomatic breadth, 12.5, 12.8; mastoid breadth, 11.3, 11.0;
alveolar length of upper molar series, 5.4, 5.3. In every measurement
the figures for Bailey's specimens are smaller than the average
of the same measurement in the 20 adults from Pennington County,
and, in most measurements, are even lower than the minimum of
the latter series. Therefore, we conclude that the material available
to Merriam (<i>op. cit.</i>) and Bailey (<i>op. cit.</i>) consisted of only subadults.</p>

<p>In comparison with a series of 23 adult <i>Clethrionomys gapperi
galei</i> from 28 mi. E Lovell, Big Horn County, Wyoming, <i>C. g. brevicaudus</i>
has a slightly shorter tail, longer hind foot, greater basal
and condylobasilar lengths, greater zygomatic and lambdoidal
breadths and conspicuously longer nasals.</p>

<p>In comparison with three adult <i>C. g. loringi</i> from Elk River, Sherburne
County, Minnesota, <i>C. g. brevicaudus</i> has a greater total
length, longer hind foot, greater basal length, conspicuously greater
zygomatic and lambdoidal breadths, much longer nasals, and a narrower
rostrum.</p>

<p><i>Clethrionomys gapperi brevicaudus</i>, although isolated geographically
and although morphologically more distinct than many of the
currently recognized subspecies of <i>C. gapperi</i>, is probably best arranged
as a subspecies of <i>C. gapperi</i> rather than as a full species.
In certain characters, such as interorbital breadth and breadth of
rostrum, it is intermediate between <i>C. g. galei</i> and <i>C. g. loringi</i>, but
it resembles <i>C. g. galei</i> more than it does any other named kind.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>--The Uinta Mountains of northern Utah and southwestern Wyoming.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>--From the description given by Doutt (Proc. Biol.
Soc. Washington, 54:161, 1941) in his original description of this
subspecies, it appears that he had available for comparisons, only
subadult specimens of <i>C. g. galei</i>. As judged from the material of
<i>C. g. uintaensis</i> available to us (1 topotype, KU 38081, and 7 specimens
from Uinta County, Wyoming, listed below) and from Doutt's
(<i>op. cit.</i>) description and measurements, the subspecies <i>C. g. uintaensis</i>
is but weakly differentiated from <i>C. g. galei</i>. No marked
cranial differences are evident between the two subspecies; the
differences in pelage noted by Doutt (<i>op. cit.</i>:161), however ("Similar
to <i>Clethrionomys gapperi galei</i> from Ward, Colorado, but head
and cheeks grayer; sides and back paler; belly whiter."), do seem
to be valid.</p>

<p>On the basis of these differences in pelage and the geographic
isolation of the range, we judge that <i>uintaensis</i> should be retained
as a subspecies of <i>C. gapperi</i>. It is clear, however, that <i>C. g. uintaensis</i>
is less distinct from <i>C. g. galei</i> than are the other adjacent
subspecies.</p>

    <span class="bold">Clethrionomys gapperi gauti</span>, new subspecies
</div>
<br />

<div class="smaller">
<p><i>Type.</i>--Male, adult, skin and skull; No. 133515, Biological Surveys Collections,
United States National Museum, from Twining, 10,700 ft., Taos County,
New Mexico; obtained on August 7, 1904, by James H. Gaut, original number
3086.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>--The Rocky Mountains of north-central New Mexico and south-central
Colorado.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>--A brightly colored <i>Clethrionomys gapperi</i>; dorsal stripe near
Chestnut (capitalized color terms after Ridgway, Color Standards and Color
Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912) with an underwash of near Light
Ochraceous-Buff and a mixture of black-tipped guard hairs giving an over-all
effect of between Tawny and Russet; braincase relatively large; zygomatic
width and lambdoidal width large; nasals long.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>--As compared with topotypes of <i>C. g. galei</i>, the color is
lighter, the dorsal reddish stripe slightly narrower, sides brighter, with a wash
of Light Ochraceous-Buff, grading ventrally into a slight wash of Pale
Ochraceous-Buff, instead of a silvery-white venter characteristic of <i>C. g. galei</i>;
zygomatic and lambdoidal breadths are greater, nasals slightly shorter, auditory
bullae slightly more inflated, teeth larger, and braincase larger.</p>

<p>As compared with topotypes of <i>C. g. limitis</i>, <i>C. g. gauti</i> is darker, has a
greater zygomatic breadth, longer upper tooth-row, longer nasals, and narrower
rostrum.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>--External and cranial measurements of the type, and the
average and extreme measurements of four adult males and one adult female
from the type locality (including the type) and five miles south of the type
locality are: Total length, 144, 147 (140-152); tail, 40, 42 (39-45); hind
foot, 20, 19.3 (19-20); condylobasilar length, 22.3, 22.9 (22.2-24.0); zygomatic
breadth, 13.6, 13.7 (13.5-14.0); lambdoidal breadth, 11.9, 11.7 (11.4-12.0);
alveolar length of upper cheek-teeth, 5.1, 5.2 (5.1-5.4); interorbital
breadth, 4.0, 3.9 (3.8-4.0); length of nasals, 7.0, 7.2 (7.0-7.6); breadth of
rostrum, 2.9, 3.1 (2.9-3.4); length of incisive foramina, 4.8, 5.1 (4.8-5.3).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>--Two specimens from a locality 21 mi. W and 3 mi. N
Saguache, Saguache County, Colorado, although referred to this
subspecies on the basis of paler pelage, inflation of auditory bullae,
and heavier teeth, show characters of <i>C. g. galei</i> in the narrowness
across the zygomata and lambdoidal crest. Four specimens from
Silverton (1 adult and 3 young adults) are referable to this subspecies
on the basis of color of pelage and cranial proportions but
are smaller than either <i>C. g. gauti</i> or <i>C. g. galei</i>.</p>

<p>The specimen from Pecos Baldy, Pecos Mountain, San Miguel
County, New Mexico, referred by Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 52:192)
to <i>Clethrionomys gapperi galei</i>, is here referred to <i>C. g. gauti</i> on
geographical grounds.</p>

<p>The name <i>gauti</i> is proposed in honor of the collector of the
type specimen, James H. Gaut.</p>

<span class="sm_blkqt">1913. <i>Evotomys limitis</i> Bailey, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 26:133,
May 21.</span>

<div class="smaller">
<p><i>Type locality.</i>--Willow Creek, a branch of the Gilita, 8500 ft., Mogollon
Mountains, Catron County, New Mexico.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>--Known from the Mogollon, San Mateo, and Magdalena mountains
of western New Mexico.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>--Bailey (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 26:133, May 21,
1913) described this animal as a species and gave as general characteristics:
"Size slightly larger than <i>E.</i> [= <i>Clethrionomys gapperi</i>]
<i>galei</i>; colors duller, grayer and less buffy; skull and dentition
heavier." He further characterized the skull as: "Larger, heavier
and conspicuously more ridged than in <i>galei</i>; bullae large and especially
deep; dentition heavy throughout." The type of <i>C. limitis</i>,
as judged from the measurements given by Bailey (<i>loc. cit.</i>), is an
exceptionally old male.</p>

<p>Our comparison of six adult topotypes with a series of <i>C. g. galei</i>
from Wyoming (18 adults from 3 mi. SSE Browns Peak, 10,000
ft., Albany County, in Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.) and with
three near-topotypes of <i>C. g. galei</i> (3 mi. S Ward, 9000 ft., Boulder
County, Colorado, in Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.) revealed that
most of the differences noted by Bailey (<i>loc. cit.</i>) are not evident
when individuals of comparable ages are examined. Some specimens
of <i>C. g. galei</i> exceed <i>C. limitis</i> in ridging of the skull and size
of the teeth although conspicuous ridges and large teeth are supposedly
distinctive of <i>C. limitis</i>. The bullae, although averaging
larger in <i>C. limitis</i>, can be matched in size by those of specimens
of <i>C. g. galei</i> from Wyoming.</p>

<p>The differences evident between <i>C. limitis</i> and <i>C. g. galei</i> are of
the kind and degree that serve to separate subspecies in the species
<i>Clethrionomys gapperi</i> and, although actual evidence of intergradation
is lacking, we think that the relationships of <i>limitis</i> are better
expressed by arranging it as a subspecies of <i>C. gapperi</i> than by
retaining it as a full species.</p>

<p><i>Type.</i>--Female, adult, skin and skull; No. 158401, Biological Surveys Collection,
United States National Museum; from Little Colorado River, 8300 ft.,
White Mountains, Apache County, Arizona; obtained September 12, 1908, by
C. Birdseye, original number 152.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>--Known only from the White Mountains of eastern Arizona.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>--Dorsal stripe near Chestnut, with an underwash of between
Tawny and Russet, and a mixture of black-tipped hairs, resulting in an overall
effect of near Chestnut. Skull wide across zygomatic arches and narrow
across mastoids; rostrum narrow and posterior border of palate straight.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>--This subspecies needs close comparison only with the adjacent
subspecies <i>C. g. limitis</i>. As compared with topotypes of <i>limitis</i>, <i>C. g.
arizonensis</i> has darker pelage, narrower rostrum, greater width across zygomatic
arches, lesser lambdoidal breadth, longer nasals, wider palate, and more
inflated auditory bullae. The posterior border of the hard palate is straight
in five skulls of the series that are complete (two skulls have the palatal regions
broken); all <i>C. g. limitis</i> examined have a median posterior projection on
the posterior border of the hard palate.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>--External and cranial measurements of the type, and the
average and extreme measurements of three adult males and two adult females
from the type locality (including the type) are: Total length, 160, 145.6
(137-160); tail, 44, 40.8 (37-46); hind foot, 18.5, 19.3 (18-20); condylobasilar
length, 23.3, 22.8 (22.1-23.5); zygomatic breadth, 13.8, 13.4 (12.6-13.8);
lambdoidal breadth, 11.5, 11.4 (11.0-11.6); alveolar length upper cheek-teeth,
5.5, 5.4 (5.2-5.5); interorbital breadth, 3.8, 3.9 (3.8-4.0); length of nasals,
7.6, 7.1 (6.9-7.6); breadth of rostrum, 3.1, 3.1 (3.0-3.2); length of incisive
foramina, 5.5, 5.2 (5.0-5.5).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>--Hall and Davis (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 47:55,
February 9, 1934) reported 12 specimens of red-backed mice from
Hannagan Meadow, 9500 to 9600 ft., and ten from Hannagan
Creek, 8600 ft., all in Greenlee County, Arizona. Although they
pointed out most of the cranial differences here described as diagnostic
of <i>C. g. arizonensis</i>, they did not name the animals as new
since they had no seasonally comparable materials; thus they were
unable to evaluate the differences noted in pelage. We have not
examined the material referred to by Hall and Davis (<i>loc. cit.</i>),
but, on the basis of their description, here refer it to <i>C. g. arizonensis</i>.</p>

<p>Grateful acknowledgment is made of the opportunity to study the specimens
from New Mexico and Arizona in the Biological Surveys Collection of
the United States National Museum and the material from South Dakota in
the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, as well as for the financial
support afforded one of us (Cockrum) by the University of Kansas from its
Research appropriation. Cockrum's work was part of a larger investigation of
the geographic distribution of all North American native mammals, aided by
a contract between the Office of Naval Research, Department of the Navy,
and the University of Kansas (NR. 161-791). Also, assistance with some of
field work was given by the Kansas University Endowment Association.</p>

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
